# chatBot.py
# Python 3.7.3 64-bit

This is an assignment where I had to make a chat bot. 

I will be taking the users input and giving them a response based off how they are feeling 

If they say happy it returns a happy reponse, sad will return a sad response Anything else will return something encouraging still

at the end it takes the users information they gave and will run until the user is done.
